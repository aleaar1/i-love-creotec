      <h1><b>Thank You, Sir Alvin<br> and Ms. Blessy! ðŸ’Œ</b></h1>
      <b>
        <p><span style="color: #e3224f">Weâ€™d like to express our deepest gratitude</span> to our supervisors, Sir Alvin and Ms. Blessy, for guiding and supporting us throughout our immersion experience at the IT Department. These past few days have been filled with learning, patience, and teamwork â€” and a big part of that came from your mentorship and encouragement.</p>

        <p>To <span style="color: #7240bd;">Sir Alvin,</span> thank you so much for being hands-on, patient, and understanding. You always took the time to help us whenever we got stuck, especially during the times we were debugging or fixing errors in our projects. You taught us <span style="color: #7240bd;">not just how to code,</span> but also how to stay calm and think logically under pressure. Even when we made mistakes or struggled to understand something, you never hesitated to explain and guide us step by step. <span style="color: #587ddb;">You</span> reminded us that learning the basics <span style="color: #587ddb;">is just as important</span> as mastering the advanced stuff, and that every problem can be solved if we work together. Your tips, insights, and sense of humor made the experience even more enjoyable â€” <span style="color: #7240bd;">weâ€™re truly grateful for everything</span> youâ€™ve shared with us.</p>

        </p>And to <span style="color: #7240bd;">Ms. Blessy,</span> even though you werenâ€™t directly handling our department, we truly appreciated how kind, approachable, and understanding you were. Every time we had concerns, you made sure <span style="color: #7240bd;">to listen and help us out in any way you could.</span> Your warmth and positive attitude made the environment lighter and more welcoming, and it showed how much you genuinely care about the trainees.</p>

    <p> <span style="color: #587ddb;">Our experience</span> in the IT Department was more than just about computers, codes, and cables â€” it was about patience, teamwork, and growth. We faced challenges, made mistakes, and learned how to overcome them together. <span style="color: #587ddb;">With your guidance,</span> we gained not only technical knowledge but also valuable lessons weâ€™ll carry beyond this immersion.</p>

        <p style="color: #e3224f">From all of us in Batch 26F IT Department, thank you, Sir Alvin and Ms. Blessy, for making our 5-day journey meaningful, memorable, and inspiring</p>
         â€“ Batch 26F, <span style="color: #587ddb;"> IT Department ðŸ’»</span>
